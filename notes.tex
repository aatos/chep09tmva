\item Pekka: git consulting, PROOF

\item Lauri 1-prog physics

\subsection{HISTORY}
\begin{itemize}
\item 081028 Project released in \url{http://github.com/aatos/chep09tmva}. Removed proceedings notes in the Appendix A to separate file {\tt notes.tex}.
\item 081021 Title and abstract focus improved after discussion in the group. 
\item 081014 First draft done after the idea to have TMVA paper at next CHEP was accepted in the group.
\end{itemize}

To be done:
\begin{itemize}
\item Template code for  analysis using latest ROOT, and TMVA inside it.
\item Revise title, abtract and paper structure including appendix.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Code repository}
Source code for paper and TMVA script\url{http://github.com/aatos/chep09tmva}

Guide \url{http://ktown.kde.org/~zrusin/git/git-cheat-sheet-medium.png}.
\subsection{Current status of TMVA}
For introduction browse, six talks from year 2008 \url{http://tmva.sourceforge.net/talks.shtml}.

\begin{itemize}
\item Current version is TMVA-v3.9.5 (2008 Aug. 9th).
\item TMVA (\url{http://tmva.cvs.sourceforge.net}) is now released as ROOT package

\begin{itemize}
\item ROOT version from 5-19-02a to 5-21-01-alice contains TMVA 3.9.4.
\end{itemize}

\item In addition to many bug fixes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Improved prepossessing
\item Pre-selection cuts on arrays. Previously used {\em TEventlists} 
(only event  wise pass/fail) were replaced by {\em TreeFormulas} (sensitive to array position).
\item Plugin capability: custom multivariate classifier can now be plugged into
    the TMVA framework to benefit from TMVA's analysis and performance comparison
    tools. 

\item For details see release notes 
\url{http://tmva.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/tmva/TMVA/development/RELNOTES}
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Code}
A code and data will be distributed using git and made abvailable 
at \\ \url{http://www.helsinki.fi/~miheikki/system/refs/heikkinen/ah09bProceedings/code}
