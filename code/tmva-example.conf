# This is an example of user configuration file. You should make a
# copy of this (e.g. to tmva-<yourname>.conf) and use it (and not
# commit it to git repository).
# See documentation about the file format in tmva-common.conf
# Note: anything specified here overwrites the configuration in
# tmva-common.conf (no appending of variables, cuts nor classifiers)

# 02.12.08 / LAW: Variable names for tau ID set
# 03.02.09 / LAW: Added larger data samples

# Include common configuration
include tmva-common.conf

Variables:
# Default value found with rectangular cuts on CMSSW in parenthesis
# =================================================================
# jet energy (ET > 119 GeV)
jetEt
# jet eta (|eta| < 2.0)
jeteta
# tracker isolation: pT threhold for tracks to be ignored in isolation annulus
#   (trigger uses cone of 0.50, signal cone=0.04, default: max pT < 0.9 GeV/c)
isolMaxPt50
# ECAL isolation: energy threshold for maximum energy in isolation annulus
#   (optimum isolation annulus 0.10-0.50, max ET < 1.9 GeV)
ecalIsolEt10_50
# Rejection of electrons and neutral hadrons (K0's):
#   variable: ET^(HCAL_0-0.40)/pT^(track)-1, default: -0.98 < hcalRatio < 0.10
hcalRatio
# tau helicity correlations (D.P.Roy, Phys.Lett.B459:607-614):
#   variable: Rtau = P(leading track) / E(jet), default: Rtau < 0.80
rtau

# Additional variables for testing
# ================================
# leading track pt (pt > 20 GeV/c set in tau trigger, variable not used)
#ldgPt
# leading track 3D impact parameter significance (works agains hadronic
#   jets, but seems to cut too much on signal; reasonable value IP>2.5)
#ldgIp3DSig
# leading track transverse impact parameter (Ipt< 0.3mm, Ipt > small value?)
#ldgIpt
# leading track z impact parameter (|Ipz|< 1 mm, |Ipz| > small value?)
#ldgIpz
# maximum deltaR of isolated track
#isolMaxDr
# matching cone of jet to leading track
#matchingCone


# Remarks
# =======
# Track quality parameters such as hit number, track chi2, hit estimate chi2,
# etc. are not simulated in the Pythia samples

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Cuts are given as they are to ROOT, so any statement understood by
# ROOT is acceptable
# These cuts are applied only to the signal tree
SignalCuts:
# choose only MC matched tau jets coming from H+
tauDecayType == 4
# choose 1 prong final states
signalTracks == 1

# These cuts are applied only to the background tree
BackgroundCuts:
# choose 1 prong final states
signalTracks == 1
