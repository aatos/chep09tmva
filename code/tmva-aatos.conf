Variables:
# Default value found with rectangular cuts on CMSSW in parenthesis
# =================================================================
# jet energy (ET > 119 GeV)
jetEt
# jet eta (|eta| < 2.0)
jeteta
# tracker isolation: pT threhold for tracks to be ignored in isolation annulus
#   (trigger uses cone of 0.50, signal cone=0.04, default: max pT < 0.9 GeV/c)
#log(isolMaxPt50)
isolMaxPt50
# ECAL isolation: energy threshold for maximum energy in isolation annulus
#   (optimum isolation annulus 0.10-0.50, max ET < 1.9 GeV)
#log(ecalIsolEt10_50)
ecalIsolEt10_50
# Rejection of electrons and neutral hadrons (K0's):
#   variable: ET^(HCAL_0-0.40)/pT^(track)-1, default: -0.98 < hcalRatio < 0.10
#log(hcalRatio)
hcalRatio
# tau helicity correlations (D.P.Roy, Phys.Lett.B459:607-614):
#   variable: Rtau = P(leading track) / E(jet), default: Rtau < 0.80
rtau

# Additional variables for testing
# ================================
# leading track pt (pt > 20 GeV/c set in tau trigger, variable not used)
#ldgPt
# leading track 3D impact parameter significance (works agains hadronic
#   jets, but seems to cut too much on signal; reasonable value IP>2.5)
#ldgIp3DSig
# HCAL energy in cone 0.40 (could also be used as ratio with jet ET)
#hcalET
#hcalET/jetEt


# Remarks
# =======
# Track quality parameters such as hit number, track chi2, hit estimate chi2,
# etc. are not simulated in the Pythia samples
