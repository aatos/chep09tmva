Infer cut orientation for each classifier from TMVA classifier output distributions

Separate classifiers to cuts and non-cuts classifiers

Create TTreeFormula objects corresponding to the TMVA preselection cuts

Initialize TMVA Reader

Initialize temporary TTree for non-cuts classifier output values

Book classifiers on reader and set branches for classifier output values

For each entry in signal and background testing TTree
  If entry doesn't pass preselection cuts
    Continue to next entry

  Get variable values from TTreeFormula

  For each non-cuts classifier
    Compute classifier output from the entry

  If current entry belongs to a different event as the previous entry
    Fill the non-cuts classifier outputs from the previous event to the temporary TTree
    Store classifier outputs from current event to the buffer
  Else
    For each non-cuts classifier
      Take min/max (depending on the cut orientation) of the buffered output value and the value from this entry,
      and store it to the buffer

  For each cuts classifier
    For each ROC bin
      If entry passes the cuts corresponding the signal efficiency value of the ROC bin
        If this event has not yet been marked as added for this ROC bin
          Add event as passed for this ROC bin

Fill the non-cuts classifier outputs from the last event to the temporary TTree

Calculate event/jet preselection efficiencies and print them

For each entry in the temporary TTree
  For each non-cuts classifier
    Fill classifier output histogram
    Fill classifier efficiency histogram

For each non-cuts classifier
  Normalize efficiency histogram
  For each ROC bin
    Get the signal efficiency value of the ROC bin
    Find the classifier output cut value corresponding to the signal efficiency
    Obtain background efficiency by imposing the the cut on background distribution
    Add background efficiency value to the ROC bin

For each cuts classifier
  Normalize efficiency histogram
  For each ROC bin
    Get the signal and background efficiencies for that bin
    Add the point to the ROC curve 

Print efficiency tables
