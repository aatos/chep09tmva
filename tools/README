= CHEP09 TMVA paper tools

This directory contains tools that assist in repository and project
maintenance tasks, such as fetching, reviewing and merging changes
from contributors. The tools are implemented in Bourne Shell (sh,
bash) language and they require Git revision control tool to work.

== Repository URL file

All repository URLs are stored in file "tools/repositories.conf" in a
two-column-format:
name URL
Example:
pekka git://github.com/kaitanie/chep09tmva.git

This file is used by the repository management scripts to set up local
Git environment.

== Repository management tools

=== Remote URL setup tool

The tool "tools/setup-remotes.sh" is intended to be run after
cloning. The tool reads repository config file and sets up remotes
automatically.

==== Command line parameters
--------
 --simulate       Don't do anything. Only print commands on the screen
 --verbose        Print detailed messages
 --help           Print this message
--------

=== Fetch assistant

Script "tools/fetch-all.sh" fetches all changes from registered remote
repositories except "origin" (i.e. your own public repository). After fetching it
tries to start "gitk" history visualization tool and show the master
branch of all remote repositories. This information can be used by the
project maintainer to track the progress of contributors, review
available changes and to decide whether a merge is needed.

NOTE: The tool does NOT (and should not) merge automatically! It
exists solely for the purpose of fetching and reviewing available
changes.

==== Command line parameters
----------
 --no-vis        Do not show gitk history visualization
 --no-fetch      Do not fetch changes
----------

== Requirements

Dependencies:
* Bourne shell (/bin/sh)
* Git distributed version control tool (http://git.or.cz)
